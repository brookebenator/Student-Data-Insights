# Student-Data-Insights

In my ISM3541 - Introduction to Business Analytics course, I analyzed an Excel spreadsheet with 6900+ rows of student-generated data. Using Excel functions such as Pivot Tables, I managed to manipulate data to extract insights about students performance levels per day. I learned more about the habits of this courses participants and determined patterns about their performance. Using PowerBI, I created a dashboard that provides intuitive analysis about performance ratings vs. other metrics and overall performance levels.
